  React Todo List

This is a simple Todo List application built with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage their tasks. The application uses local storage to persist the data, ensuring that the tasks are saved even when the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.

   Features

-   Add Task  : Users can add new tasks to the list.
-   Edit Task  : Users can edit existing tasks.
-   Delete Task  : Users can remove tasks from the list.
-   Toggle Completion  : Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
-   Persistent Storage  : Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain even after closing the browser.
